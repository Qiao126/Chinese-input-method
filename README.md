# Chinese-input-method
In both gen_bicount and segment folder, you need to add your own train data, I can't upload beacuse it is too large. The file shuould be named "train" and the content is in Chinese of course like in "./segment/train.001"._

implemented Chinese segment and used bi-gram language model.
